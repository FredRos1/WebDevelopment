            <h1><b>2: Dress to elevate</b></h1>
            <p>
               When you are young people are going to automatically discredit you, you don’t want to make it worse by the way you dress. Don’t go wearing big branded clothes, it will make you look like a showoff so don’t do that. This means that don’t go to a business meeting wearing that, people will look down on you. Of course you can wear it if that means your going to a family meeting or just chilling at home.

Business well humble you because no matter how good you are when you get into the word of the market well tell you how good you are. Lets say you’re business is taking of and you haring you’re first employee and they leave because a the work isn’t enjoyable enough or potentially maybe your not a inspiring leader. Maybe I wasn’t a sort of leader where my team was like I would follow you into war. So whether it’s business whether is combat sports you need some thing external in your life to humble you and but you in your place

    <h1><b>5: small circle big influence </b></h1>
    <p>
       Theres is nothing wrong with many people knowing you or with you having man acquaintances but you should have very few friends and here’s the thing most people in this fake life don’t know the difference between acquaintance and a friend because most people don’t understand what true loyalty is. They are around people that thay don’t like they’re around for clout or money. Keep your circle tight but you’re influence Lage, many people can and should know a few and im not talking about having a massive social media following

    <p>God will all was test you to se what you can andt can’t handle. And this is very important because becoming successful and making you’re fist million in your teen or your early 20s that’s great. Can you keep it now and can you not only can  you multiply it because that’s a lot of pressure. Listen if you make your fist million dollars when you’re 18 or 20thats great but that’s a lot of pressure every year after that can you hold that same standard so you need to understand the God if he blesses you if he gives you that million at a young age he’s goner see if you can handle it
